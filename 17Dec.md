## CI/CD – Basics

- CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**

- Used to automate:
  - Code building
  - Testing
  - Deployment


## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Developers push code frequently to a shared repository
- Every change is automatically:
  - Built
  - Tested
- Goal is to catch issues early


### Source Code Management
- Code is stored in a central repo (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Developers push changes using commits

### Build
- Code is compiled or packaged
- Ensures the application can be built successfully


### Automated Testing
- Unit tests and basic checks are run
- Confirms new code doesn’t break existing functionality


## Why CI is Important
- Reduces integration problems
- Improves code quality
- Makes deployments more reliable
